## Installation
You can download the [provided Material-HBC.zip](/Material-HBC.zip) to skip step 1 and 2.  
To manually put it together:
1. Compress the contents of "dist/theme/" into theme.zip. Do **not** include the dist/theme/ folder when compressing!
2. Place your newly created "theme.zip" along with "dist/meta.xml" and "dist/icon.png" into a single folder, with a name of your choice (I'd recommend something along the lines of "Material-HBC").
3. Place the folder into the apps directory on your SD card, and install the theme like any other HBC application.

## Uninstallation
To revert to the default theme, you can remove the HBC save file on the Wii, which will also remove any custom preferences for the HBC.  
  
It is also possible to install another theme, as this will overwrite the previously installed theme.  
**By installing the origin [Dark Waters](https://www.wiibrew.org/w/images/4/4c/Dark_Waters.zip) theme you can revert HBC to the original look without losing any custom preferences.**
